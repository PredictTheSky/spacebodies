Space Bodies
============

Space Bodies is the library that powers `Predict the Sky
<http://predictthesky.org>`_. It handles calculating space object positions and
then combines that with weather data to tell you what you can see in the sky.
The library is named after the primary class. Astronomical objects are
sometimes called "bodies", thus the name.

It uses a simple plugin system for supporting different astronomical objects,
which is exposed as a standardised interface.

.. code-block:: pycon
